## Planning and Development Process

I started by making the necessary component hierarchy and implementing the router and the navbar. Then started adding features one by one , and kept the styling for the end.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

lots and lots of googling and reading official documentation.

### Unsolved problems

searchbar autosuggest and autocomplete.
